# gll
Grammar Tool for LL(1) Grammars

GLL is a tool to verify and visualise LL(1) grammars.  It parses EBNF
specifications of grammars, calculates FIRST and FOLLOW sets, reports
any LL(1) violations and generates (railroad) syntax diagrams.

Eventually it is intended to add a lexer and parser generator.
